## 🆘 Emergency Fixes

**Problem:** Desk image not showing on landing page

**Problem:** Book/eraser clicks don't work  
**Fix:** Clear browser cache, reload page

**Problem:** Styling looks broken  
**Fix:** Ensure `styles.css` is in the same folder as all HTML files

**Problem:** Can't find the files  
**Fix:** They're all in the outputs folder - download them all together

## 📱 Share Your Portfolio

Once live, share on:
- LinkedIn (pin it to your profile!)
- Resume/CV (add the URL)
- Email signature
- GitHub profile README
- Job applications

## 🎉 You're Done!

Your portfolio is now:
- ✅ Live on the internet
- ✅ Interactive and engaging
- ✅ Professional looking
- ✅ Mobile friendly
- ✅ Easy to update

## Next Steps

1. Deploy now (even if not 100% customized)
2. Share with one person for feedback
3. Update content gradually
4. Track your visitors (optional analytics)
5. Update regularly with new projects

**Remember:** A live portfolio with placeholder projects is better than a perfect portfolio that never gets published. Ship it now, improve it later!
